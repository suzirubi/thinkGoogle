# CSS Week Two Independent Project
_*Epicodus CSS Responsive Design Week One Project, 12-1-16*_

by Suzi Rubino

##Description
Replicate the responsive top section of "Think with Google". Note: Navigation bar is optional. It does not need to be pixel-perfect (though as an aspiring front-end developer, you should always try to make it so), nor does it need to use the same styling/code techniques as their actual website. Prioritize responsiveness and structure. You have enough CSS knowledge to accomplish this without having to peak at their code -- resist temptation!
As always, it does not need to incorporate the same assets (e.g. images, fonts).
USE ANY METHOD OF RESPONSIVE LAYOUT YOU'RE COMFORTABLE WITH -- whether it's 100% custom floats/queries, Bootstrap's grid, or a favorite framework from Thursday's classwork.
